Why Outside-in TDD Still Matters in the Cursor AI Era

## Abstract in English

In an era where Generative AI tools like Cursor can produce hundreds of lines of code in seconds, the discipline of Outside-in Test-Driven Development (TDD) has become more crucial than ever. This talk explores how the London school approach to TDD serves as the essential bridge between human intent and AI-generated implementation.

We'll examine the central process of Outside-in TDD: starting from user behavior and business requirements, translating them into precise acceptance criteria, and then driving implementation through failing tests that guide both human developers and AI assistants toward the right solution. When requirements are well-crafted and acceptance criteria are clearly defined, AI tools become powerful allies in the red-green-refactor cycle, capable of generating not just any working code, but the *right* code that satisfies real user needs.

Through live demonstrations using Cursor AI, we'll show how the Outside-in approach transforms the developer-AI collaboration from "generate and hope" to "specify and validate." You'll learn how to leverage AI's speed while maintaining the disciplined thinking that ensures your software solves actual problems. We'll explore how mock-driven development helps define clear interfaces before implementation, how acceptance tests serve as executable specifications for AI tools, and why the outside-in mindset prevents the common pitfall of AI-generated code that works but doesn't deliver value.

Whether you're skeptical about AI's role in development or already using tools like Cursor daily, this talk will demonstrate that good engineering practices don't become obsoleteâ€”they become amplifiers for AI's potential. Walk away with practical strategies for combining the thoughtfulness of Outside-in TDD with the productivity of modern AI development tools.

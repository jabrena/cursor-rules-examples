## Feature Overview

### Summary
Develop comprehensive REST API endpoints that provide reliable access to Greek mythology data, enabling educational platforms and applications to programmatically retrieve curated deity information through a standardized, high-performance API interface.

### Business Value
**Enhanced Educational Platform Integration** - This feature delivers the core value proposition of the epic by providing developers with fast, reliable API access to Greek mythology data. It enables educational platforms to seamlessly integrate rich content without depending on external service availability, improving user experience and application reliability.

### Target Users
- **API consumers/developers** - Primary users who integrate these endpoints into their applications
- **Educational platform developers** - Secondary users building learning management systems
- **Application integrators** - Third-party developers creating mythology-focused applications

---

## Problem Statement

Educational platforms and applications need reliable, fast access to Greek mythology data but currently face challenges with:
- Direct dependency on external service availability and performance
- Inconsistent response times from third-party APIs
- Lack of standardized data format for mythology information
- No guarantee of data availability during peak usage periods

---

## Solution Approach

**RESTful API endpoints with local data persistence**, providing:
- Fast response times through optimized database access (< 1 second requirement)
- Reliable data availability independent of external service status
- Standardized JSON response format following OpenAPI 3.0.3 specification
- Comprehensive error handling and HTTP status code implementation

---

## Success Criteria

### Primary Success Metrics
- **API Response Time:** All endpoints respond in less than 1 second (99% of requests)
- **API Availability:** 99.9% uptime for all endpoints
- **Data Completeness:** 100% of synchronized Greek god data accessible via API

### Key Performance Indicators
- Average response time per endpoint
- API error rate (target: < 0.1%)
- Concurrent user capacity (target: 1000+ simultaneous requests)
- Developer adoption rate and integration success

---

## Functional Requirements

### Core API Endpoints

#### 1. Get All Greek Gods
**Endpoint:** `GET /api/v1/gods/greek`
- Returns complete list of all Greek god names
- Simple array response format
- Includes god names as string values

### Response Format Standards

#### Successful Response Structure
```json
[
  "Zeus",

  "Tyche"
]
```

#### Error Response Structure
```json
{
  "error": "Internal server error",
  "status": 500
}
```

## User Stories

### Epic-Level User Stories

**As an API consumer,**
I want to retrieve Greek god data through REST endpoints
So that I can integrate mythology content into my educational application.

**As an educational platform developer,**
I want fast, reliable access to mythology data
So that my users experience consistent performance regardless of external service status.

**As an application integrator,**
I want comprehensive API documentation with examples
So that I can quickly understand and implement the integration.

### Feature-Specific User Stories

1. **Data Retrieval**
   - As an API consumer, I want to get a list of all Greek god names so that I can display them in my application
   - As a developer, I want to retrieve god names in a simple format so that I can easily process the data
   - As an integrator, I want a straightforward array response so that I can implement basic god selection functionality

2. **Performance and Reliability**
   - As an API consumer, I want sub-second response times so that my application remains responsive
   - As a platform developer, I want guaranteed uptime so that my service remains available to users
   - As an integrator, I want consistent data format so that my parsing logic remains stable

3. **Error Handling**
   - As an API consumer, I want clear error messages so that I can handle failures appropriately
   - As a developer, I want proper HTTP status codes so that I can implement correct error handling
   - As an integrator, I want detailed error information so that I can debug integration issues

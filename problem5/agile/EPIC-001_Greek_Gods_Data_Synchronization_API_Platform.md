# Epic: Greek Gods Data Synchronization API Platform

**Epic ID:** EPIC-001  
**Owner:** Juan Antonio Breña Moral  
**Status:** Planning  
**Created:** December 19, 2024

---

## Executive Summary

This epic focuses on developing a comprehensive REST API platform that provides reliable access to Greek mythology data through synchronized data retrieval from external sources, targeting educational platform enhancement and API consumers.

### Business Value
**Educational Platform Enhancement** - This epic will deliver a robust, performant API service that enables educational platforms and applications to integrate rich Greek mythology content, enhancing learning experiences through programmatic access to curated deity information.

### Target Users
- **API consumers/developers** - Primary users who will integrate the API into their applications and services

---

## Problem Statement

Develop a REST API that reads Greek god data which is synchronized periodically from a third party service. Current challenges include the need for reliable access to mythology data without directly depending on external service availability and performance limitations.

---

## Solution Overview

A **RESTful API service with background synchronization from external data sources, providing reliable access to mythology data with persistence layer**, using a PostgreSQL database for the storage layer. The solution includes:

- Local data persistence to ensure availability
- Background synchronization to maintain data freshness
- Fast response times through direct database access
- Robust error handling for external service dependencies

---

## Success Criteria

### Primary Success Metrics
- **API Response Time:** All API endpoints must respond in less than 1 second
- **Data Availability:** 99.9% uptime for API service regardless of external service status
- **Data Freshness:** Successfully synchronize data from external sources with minimal latency

### Key Performance Indicators
- API response time consistently under 1 second
- Successful data synchronization rate
- API endpoint reliability and availability metrics

---

## Key Features and Components

This epic encompasses the following major components:

### 1. REST API Endpoints for Greek God Data Retrieval
- Public API endpoints following OpenAPI 3.0.3 specification
- JSON response format with standardized error handling
- RESTful design principles and HTTP status codes

### 2. Background Data Synchronization Service
- Automated synchronization from external APIs
- Scheduled data refresh processes
- Data validation and consistency checks

### 3. Database Persistence Layer with Schema Management
- PostgreSQL database implementation
- Optimized schema for Greek god data storage
- Data migration and version management

### 4. Error Handling and Timeout Management
- Robust error handling for external API calls
- Timeout management for external service dependencies
- Graceful degradation when external services are unavailable

### 5. API Documentation and OpenAPI Specifications
- Complete OpenAPI specifications
- Developer documentation and examples
- API versioning and backward compatibility

---

## Dependencies

### External Dependencies
- **Third-party JSON Server:** https://my-json-server.typicode.com/jabrena/latency-problems
  - Critical dependency for data source
  - Potential impact from service availability and performance

### Infrastructure Dependencies
- **PostgreSQL Database:** Required for data persistence layer
  - Database server setup and configuration
  - Connection pooling and performance optimization

### Technical Dependencies
- Application runtime environment
- HTTP client libraries for external API integration
- Database connectivity and ORM frameworks

---

## Assumptions and Risks

### Key Assumptions
- External API service will maintain reasonable availability
- PostgreSQL database infrastructure will be available and performant
- API consumers will follow standard HTTP client practices

### Identified Risks
- **External API Availability:** Risk of 504 Gateway timeout and service unavailability
  - *Mitigation:* Local data persistence and graceful degradation
- **Data Consistency:** Risk of inconsistency between external source and local storage
  - *Mitigation:* Data validation and reconciliation processes
- **Performance Under Load:** Risk of degraded performance with increased usage
  - *Mitigation:* Database optimization and connection pooling strategies

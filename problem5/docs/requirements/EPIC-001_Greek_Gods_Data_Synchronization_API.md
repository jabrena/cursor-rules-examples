# Epic: EPIC-001: Greek Gods Data Synchronization API

**Epic Owner:** Product Owner / Development Team Lead

---

## Business Value & Strategic Goals

Develop a robust REST API system that provides reliable access to Greek gods data by synchronizing information from a third-party service. This epic delivers value by creating a centralized, performant data service that reduces external API dependencies, improves response times, and ensures data availability even when external services are temporarily unavailable.

### Target Users
- **API Consumers**: Applications and services that need Greek gods data
- **Developers**: Who will integrate with the REST API endpoints
- **System Administrators**: Who will monitor and maintain the synchronization process

### Success Criteria
- REST API responds to queries within 200ms for 95% of requests
- Data synchronization occurs reliably without manual intervention
- API achieves 99.5% uptime
- External service failures do not prevent API responses (cached data available)
- Database schema supports efficient querying and data integrity

---

## Problem Statement

Current applications requiring Greek gods data must directly call external third-party services, which introduces several challenges:
- **Latency Issues**: Direct calls to external APIs create variable response times
- **Reliability Concerns**: External service downtime affects application functionality
- **Rate Limiting**: Multiple applications hitting the same external service may cause throttling
- **Data Consistency**: No centralized control over data formatting or validation
- **Monitoring Gaps**: Difficult to track usage patterns and performance metrics

---

## Solution Overview

Implement a microservice architecture consisting of:

1. **REST API Layer**: Provides standardized endpoints for retrieving Greek gods data
2. **Database Layer**: Local PostgreSQL database storing synchronized Greek gods information
3. **Synchronization Service**: Periodic background service that fetches data from external API and updates local database
4. **Data Validation**: Ensures data integrity during synchronization process
5. **Monitoring & Logging**: Comprehensive observability for performance tracking and troubleshooting

The solution follows the patterns shown in the provided UML sequence diagram and C4 component model.

## Key Features & Components

- **Greek Gods REST API**: HTTP endpoints returning Greek gods data in JSON format (`/api/v1/gods/greek`)
- **Data Synchronization Engine**: Automated service to fetch and update data from external source
- **Database Schema Management**: PostgreSQL tables with proper indexing and constraints
- **Error Handling & Resilience**: Graceful handling of external service failures
- **API Documentation**: OpenAPI specification for consumer integration
- **Health Checks**: Endpoints for monitoring service and database connectivity
- **Data Validation**: Input/output validation ensuring data quality

## User Stories

_User stories for this epic will be defined and linked here as they are created._

## Dependencies

- **External API Availability**: Dependent on `https://my-json-server.typicode.com/jabrena/latency-problems/greek` endpoint
- **Database Infrastructure**: PostgreSQL database environment setup
- **Framework Dependencies**: Spring Boot framework for REST API development
- **Deployment Environment**: Application server and database hosting infrastructure
- **Monitoring Tools**: Integration with logging and monitoring solutions

---

## Risks & Assumptions

### Risks
- External API service may become permanently unavailable
- External API may change data format without notice
- Database performance may degrade with data growth
- Network connectivity issues during synchronization
- Potential data inconsistencies during sync failures

### Assumptions
- External API will maintain current JSON response format
- Database infrastructure can handle expected load
- Synchronization frequency requirements are not yet specified
- Standard HTTP REST patterns are acceptable for consumers
- PostgreSQL is the approved database technology

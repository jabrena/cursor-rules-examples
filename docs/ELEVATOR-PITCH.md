# Elevator Pitch

## English Version

Think about it: AI can generate hundreds of lines of code in seconds, but is it the *right* code? Most developers are stuck in "generate and hope" mode, creating impressive-looking code that doesn't solve real problems.

Here's the game-changer: Outside-in TDD isn't becoming obsolete in the AI era—it's becoming your secret weapon. When you start with user needs, craft clear acceptance criteria, and let failing tests guide your AI assistant, something magical happens. Instead of generating random code, AI becomes your precision instrument, creating exactly what users need.

I'll show you live how this works with Cursor AI—how the London school approach transforms your relationship with AI from chaotic code generation to disciplined, user-focused development. You'll see developers who master this combination aren't just keeping up with AI—they're leaving everyone else behind.

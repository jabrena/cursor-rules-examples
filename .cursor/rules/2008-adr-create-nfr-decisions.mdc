# Cursor rule to create ADR files for Non-Functional Requirements in a conversational way

This rule guides the AI to create Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) specifically focused on non-functional requirements with emphasis on security, performance, and scalability. The AI will ask targeted questions to gather all necessary information and then generate a well-structured ADR in Markdown format following the standard ADR template.

Instructions for the AI (Content of the Rule):

"When activated, you should guide the user through creating an Architecture Decision Record (ADR) for non-functional requirements by following these steps:

Phase 1: Information Gathering
Acknowledge the request and inform the user that you need to ask some questions to create a comprehensive ADR. Then, ask the following questions, waiting for their input after each block or as appropriate:

**ADR Basic Information:**
1. ADR Number/ID: "What is the unique identifier for this ADR? (e.g., ADR-001, ADR-Security-001)"
2. Title: "What is a concise, descriptive title for this architectural decision? (e.g., 'API Rate Limiting Strategy', 'Database Encryption Implementation')"
3. Date: "What is the decision date? (If not specified, I'll use today's date)"
4. Status: "What is the current status of this decision? (Proposed, Accepted, Superseded, Deprecated, or Rejected)"

**Decision Context:**
5. Problem Statement: "What specific non-functional requirement or architectural challenge are you addressing? Please describe the current situation and what needs to be improved or implemented."
6. Forces and Constraints: "What are the key factors influencing this decision? Consider technical constraints, business requirements, compliance needs, budget limitations, timeline constraints, etc."

**Non-Functional Requirements Focus:**
7. Primary NFR Category: "Which is the primary non-functional requirement category for this decision? (Security, Performance, Scalability, Reliability, Availability, Maintainability, Usability, or Other)"

**If Security is primary or mentioned:**
- "What specific security concerns are being addressed? (e.g., data protection, authentication, authorization, encryption, compliance requirements like GDPR/HIPAA)"
- "Are there any security standards or frameworks that must be followed? (e.g., OWASP, ISO 27001, SOC 2)"

**If Performance is primary or mentioned:**
- "What are the specific performance requirements or targets? (e.g., response time < 200ms, throughput > 1000 TPS, latency requirements)"
- "What are the current performance bottlenecks or concerns?"

**If Scalability is primary or mentioned:**
- "What are the expected growth patterns? (user growth, data volume, geographic expansion)"
- "What are the scalability targets? (concurrent users, requests per second, data storage requirements)"

8. Quality Attributes: "Are there additional quality attributes that this decision impacts? Please specify any requirements for reliability, availability, maintainability, testability, etc."

**Decision Options:**
9. Alternative Solutions: "What are the different approaches or solutions you considered? Please list at least 2-3 alternatives including their main characteristics."

For each alternative, ask:
- "What are the pros and cons of [Alternative Name]?"
- "How does [Alternative Name] address the security/performance/scalability requirements?"
- "What are the implementation costs and complexity for [Alternative Name]?"

**Decision Details:**
10. Chosen Solution: "Which alternative did you choose and why? What were the deciding factors?"
11. Rationale: "What is the detailed reasoning behind this choice? How does it best address the non-functional requirements?"

**Implementation and Impact:**
12. Implementation Approach: "How will this decision be implemented? What are the key implementation steps or phases?"
13. Impact Assessment: "What systems, components, or teams will be affected by this decision?"
14. Risks and Mitigation: "What are the potential risks of this decision and how will they be mitigated?"
15. Success Metrics: "How will you measure the success of this decision? What metrics will you track? (e.g., performance benchmarks, security audit results, scalability test outcomes)"

**Compliance and Governance:**
16. Compliance Requirements: "Are there any regulatory or compliance requirements this decision must satisfy?"
17. Review and Approval: "Who needs to review and approve this decision? Any stakeholders that must sign off?"

**Documentation:**
18. Related Documents: "Are there any related documents, previous ADRs, technical specifications, or external references that should be linked?"
19. ADR Filename: "What should be the filename for this ADR? (e.g., `ADR-001-API-Rate-Limiting.md`, `ADR-Security-001-Database-Encryption.md`)"

Phase 2: ADR Generation
Once all information is gathered, inform the user you will now generate the ADR content. Then, provide the content clearly formatted:

**Content for ADR File: `[ADR Filename From Input]`**
```markdown
# [ADR Number/ID]: [Title]

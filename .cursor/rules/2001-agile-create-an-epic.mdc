# Create agile epics

This rule guides the AI to systematically gather information and generate a comprehensive epic definition in Markdown format. An epic represents a large body of work that can be broken down into smaller user stories, features, or tasks.

Instructions for the AI (Content of the Rule):

"When activated, you should guide the user through creating an agile epic by following these steps:

Phase 1: Information Gathering
Acknowledge the request and inform the user that you need to ask some questions to create a well-structured epic. Then, ask the following questions, waiting for their input after each block:

**Epic Core Details:**
1. Epic Title/ID: "What is a concise, descriptive title for this epic? Include an ID if you have one (e.g., 'EPIC-001: Customer Self-Service Portal')."
2. Epic Owner: "Who is the epic owner or product owner responsible for this epic?"
3. Business Value: "What is the primary business value or strategic goal this epic will deliver? Why is this epic important to the organization?"
4. Target Users: "Who are the primary users or personas that will benefit from this epic? (e.g., 'customers', 'internal staff', 'administrators')"

**Epic Scope and Context:**
5. Problem Statement: "What specific problem or opportunity does this epic address? What pain points will it solve?"
6. Solution Overview: "Provide a high-level description of the proposed solution or approach."
7. Success Criteria: "How will you measure the success of this epic? What are the key metrics or outcomes you expect?"
8. Dependencies: "Are there any dependencies on other epics, systems, or external factors that could impact this epic?"

**Epic Breakdown:**
9. Key Features/Components: "What are the main features, components, or capabilities that will be included in this epic? List 3-7 high-level items."

**Timeline and Planning:**
10. Risks and Assumptions: "What are the key risks, assumptions, or unknowns related to this epic?"

**Documentation and Linking:**
11. Epic Filename: "What should be the filename for this epic document? (e.g., 'EPIC-001_Customer_Self_Service_Portal.md')"
12. Related Documentation: "Are there any related documents, mockups, technical specifications, or other epics that should be referenced?"

Phase 2: Epic Document Generation
Once all information is gathered, inform the user you will now generate the epic document. Then, provide the content:

**Content for Epic Markdown File: `[Epic Filename From Input]`**
```markdown

## Epic Progress

**Status:** Not Started  
**Completion:** 0%

### Milestones
- [ ] Epic planning and breakdown complete
- [ ] User stories defined and estimated
- [ ] Development started
- [ ] First increment delivered
- [ ] User testing completed
- [ ] Epic completed and deployed

**Created:** [Current Date]  
**Last Updated:** [Current Date]
```

After generating the content, provide these additional recommendations:

**Next Steps:**
1. Review and refine the epic with stakeholders
2. Break down the epic into specific user stories
3. Estimate the user stories and plan sprints
4. Create any necessary technical documentation
5. Set up tracking and monitoring for success criteria

**Tips for Epic Management:**
- Keep the epic focused on a single, cohesive business goal
- Regularly review and update the epic as new information emerges
- Ensure all user stories clearly contribute to the epic's success criteria
- Monitor progress and adjust scope if needed to meet timeline constraints

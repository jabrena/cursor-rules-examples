# Cursor Rules Examples

## Motivation

Probe the help of the **Cursor rules for Java** with non trivial Java problems.

## Getting started

1. Maven project creation

```bash
jbang setup@jabrena init --maven
```

2. Have a conversation with the LLM to improve the initial requirements:

```bash
how to improve this gherkin? What questions do you consider useful to be anwered in order to update this gherkin file?
```

3. Ask for an initial implementation

```bash
implement a solution in the package info.jab.latency from src. Create a solution and later add test classes. Verify the changes with the command: ./mvnw clean verify
```

4. Begin the refactoring

```bash
PENDING
```
